# Weather API App

This App allows users to get weather and temperature of almost all the cities in the world

## Getting Started 

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.10

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Environment

It is recommended to work within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the directory where you have your `python` file and running:

```
pip install requests
      OR
pip3 install requests
      OR
python3 -m pip install requests
```
